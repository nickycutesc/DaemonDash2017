Food Finder

To start run this program, you must import data.csv into your local database. More information is as follows: 
	host = "localhost"
	user = "fooduser"
	password = "findyourfood"
	database = "foodfinder"
	table = "restaurants"
Visit the main.php link, choose the types of food youâ€™re looking for, click submit, and now you should be able to visualize the map of where the certain foods are located and be able to click on the pop-up markers to get the address of where you want to eat (restaurant names were not available in the dataset).
